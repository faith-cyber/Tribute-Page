        <h1 class="title"> The Life Of Obafemi Awolowo</h1>
        <p><strong>Obafemi Awolowo (1909-1987) was a Nigerian nationalist, a political leader, and a principal participant in the struggle for Nigerian independence.</strong></p>

        <p>Obafemi Awolowo was born in Ikenné, Western State, Nigeria, on March 6, 1909. He received his early education in the mission schools of Ikenné, Abeokuta, and Ibadan. Often he worked at odd jobs to raise money for tuition fees, and his entrepreneurial spirit continued to express itself in the various careers which he subsequently sampled: journalist, teacher, clerk, moneylender, taxidriver, produce broker. His organizational and political inclinations became evident as he moved to high-level positions in the Nigerian Motor Transport Union, the Nigerian Produce Traders' Association, the Trades Union Congress of Nigeria, and the Nigerian Youth Movement, of which he became Western Provincial secretary.</p>

        <p>Awolowo went to London in 1944 to study law, and while there he founded the Egbe Omo Oduduwa (Yoruba: “Society of the Descendants of Oduduwa”) to promote the culture and unity of the Yoruba people, one of the three largest ethnic groups in colonial Nigeria, and to ensure a secure future for them. During that period Awolowo also wrote the influential Path to Nigerian Freedom (1947), in which he made his case for the need of a federal form of government in an independent Nigeria to safeguard the interests of each ethnic nationality and region and to create a sustainable basis for Nigerian unity. He also called for rapid progress toward self-government.</p>

        <p>In 1947 Awolowo returned to Ibadan to practice law, and the following year he established the Egbe Omo Oduduwa in Nigeria. In 1950–51 he founded a political party, the Action Group, with some of the Egbe’s members as its nucleus, and in the process became the party’s first president. The party called for an immediate end to British rule and for the development of several social welfare programs. In 1951 the party won the first elections held in the Western Region, one of the colony’s three administrative divisions, and Awolowo later served as leader of government business and minister for local government structure, the latter for which he established elective councils. From 1954 to 1959, as premier of the Western Region, Awolowo worked to improve education, social services, and agricultural practices, implementing many progressive policies. Notably, his administration introduced programs that provided free health care for children and free universal primary education. The first television station in Africa was established in the Western Region by his administration as well.</p>

        <p>An important figure in Nigerian history, Awolowo’s ideals and accomplishments continue to influence Nigerian politics. He wrote several books, including Awo: The Autobiography of Chief Obafemi Awolowo (1960) and Thoughts on Nigerian Constitution (1966).</p>
